# Getting an SCRC Account

This guide provides instructions for obtaining access to the NYU Stern Center for Research Computing (SCRC) resources. SCRC uses Stern accounts (NetID and password) for authentication. The process differs depending on your affiliation with NYU and the Stern School of Business.

## Stern Users

If you are a member of the Stern School of Business (faculty, PhD student, staff, or enrolled in a Stern course), you can use your existing activated Stern account (Stern NetID and password) to access SCRC services.

*   **Requirement:** An active Stern NetID and password.
*   **Action:** If you have not yet activated your Stern account, please do so here: [Activate Stern Account](http://start.stern.nyu.edu)
*   Once activated, you can use your Stern credentials to log in to SCRC systems.

## Non-Stern NYU Users

If you are affiliated with NYU but are not part of the Stern School of Business (and not enrolled in a Stern course), you need sponsorship from a full-time Stern employee to obtain a Stern account for SCRC access.

*   **Requirement:** An existing NYU NetID and sponsorship from a full-time Stern employee.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Your Stern sponsor must contact the Stern IT Help Desk on your behalf.
    2.  The sponsor needs to provide the following information to the Help Desk:
        *   Your Full Name
        *   Your NYU NetID
        *   Your NYU UniversityID (N#)
        *   Your Date of birth
        *   Sponsor's name (Stern faculty or employee)
        *   Sponsoring department
        *   Expiration date for access (maximum 1 year; extensions can be requested yearly)
*   **Contact:**
    *   Stern IT Help Desk: `helpdesk@stern.nyu.edu`
    *   Phone: 212-998-0180
*   **Action:** After the account is created, you must [activate your Stern account](http://start.stern.nyu.edu) before you can use SCRC services.

## Non-NYU Collaborators

Users who are not affiliated with NYU (e.g., external collaborators) must first obtain an NYU NetID through sponsorship, and then obtain Stern account sponsorship for SCRC access. This is a two-step process.

### Step 1: Obtain an NYU NetID

*   **Requirement:** Sponsorship from an authorized NYU sponsor (typically a Stern faculty member or departmental coordinator).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Your authorized sponsor requests an NYU NetID for you by filling out the IT Onboarding Form.
    2.  **Accessing the Form:** The sponsor must:
        *   Log in to the [NYU VPN](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/getting-connected/vpn.html).
        *   Log in to [identity.it.nyu.edu](https://identity.it.nyu.edu/).
        *   Click the hamburger menu (â˜°).
        *   Select "Request Affiliate".
        *   Select "Request Affiliate User".
*   **Support:** For assistance with the NYU NetID request process, your sponsor can contact NYU IT support:
    *   Email: `AskIT@nyu.edu`
    *   Phone: 212-998-3333

### Step 2: Obtain Stern Account Sponsorship

*   **Requirement:** An active NYU NetID (obtained in Step 1) and sponsorship from a full-time Stern employee (this may be the same sponsor as in Step 1).
*   **Process:** Once you have your NYU NetID, your Stern sponsor must follow the process outlined above for **Non-Stern NYU Users** to request Stern account access for you. They will need to contact the Stern IT Help Desk with the required information (Full Name, NYU NetID, N#, DOB, Sponsor Name, Department, Expiration Date).
*   **Action:** After the Stern account is created, you must [activate your Stern account](http://start.stern.nyu.edu) before you can use SCRC services.
