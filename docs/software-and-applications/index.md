# Software And Applications

Welcome to the Software and Applications section of the SCRC documentation! This is your central hub for understanding how to access, manage, and effectively utilize the diverse range of software available on our computing resources.

Whether you need to load a specific version of a statistical package, set up an isolated environment for your Python project, install custom R packages, or simply see what tools are available, you'll find the necessary guidance here.

## Key Concepts

*   **Available Software:** We provide access to a wide variety of research software, from compilers and programming languages (Python, R, Java) to specialized applications (MATLAB, Stata, SAS) and data analysis tools.
*   **Modules System (`module` command):** This is the primary way software environments are managed on the SCRC clusters. It allows multiple versions of software to coexist without conflicts and lets you easily load the specific version you need for your work.
*   **Virtual Environments & Local Libraries:** For languages like Python and R, managing project-specific dependencies is crucial. Learn how to create isolated environments (like Python virtual environments) and install packages locally without interfering with system-wide installations.
*   **Running Applications:** Find instructions for running specific applications, including those with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like RStudio or XStata, often facilitated through services like FastX or accessed via other platforms like Apps@Stern.
