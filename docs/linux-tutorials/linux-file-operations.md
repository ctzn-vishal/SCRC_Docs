# Linux File Operations

This tutorial covers essential Linux commands for managing files and directories via the command line interface (Shell). You will learn how to create, edit, copy, move, rename, and delete files and directories.

Most Linux commands follow a common syntax:

```bash
command -options arguments
```

**Note:** Linux is case-sensitive. Command names are typically lowercase, and filenames like `MyFile` and `myfile` are treated as distinct.

## Creating and Editing Files

### Using `nano`

`nano` is a simple, beginner-friendly text editor commonly used in Linux environments to create or edit files.

To create a new file or open an existing one for editing:

```bash
nano filename.txt
```

For example, to create or edit a file named `costdata.dat`:

```bash
nano costdata.dat
```

Inside the `nano` editor, you'll see the file content area and a list of commands at the bottom. The `^` symbol represents the `Ctrl` key.

*   **Save:** Press `Ctrl+O` (Write Out) and confirm the filename by pressing Enter.
*   **Exit:** Press `Ctrl+X`. If you have unsaved changes, `nano` will ask if you want to save them.

## Copying Files

The `cp` command is used to copy files or directories.

**Syntax:**

```bash
cp source_file destination_file
```

**Example:** To make a backup copy of `costdata.dat` named `costdata.dat.bak`:

```bash
cp costdata.dat costdata.dat.bak
```

This creates a new file `costdata.dat.bak` with the same content as `costdata.dat`. The original file `costdata.dat` remains unchanged.

## Moving and Renaming Files

The `mv` command is used to move files or directories from one location to another, or to rename them.

**Syntax (Renaming):**

```bash
mv old_filename new_filename
```

**Example:** To rename the file `costdata.dat.bak` to `newcostdata.dat`:

```bash
mv costdata.dat.bak newcostdata.dat
```

**Syntax (Moving):**

```bash
mv source_file destination_directory/
```

**Example:** To move `newcostdata.dat` into a directory named `archives`:

```bash
mv newcostdata.dat archives/
```

## Deleting Files

The `rm` command is used to remove (delete) files.

**Syntax:**

```bash
rm filename
```

**Example:** To delete the file `costdata.dat`:

```bash
rm costdata.dat
```

**Warning:** Files deleted with `rm` are permanently removed. There is no "Trash" or "Recycle Bin" in the standard Linux command line. Exercise caution when using `rm`.

### Using Wildcards with `rm`

The asterisk (`*`) is a wildcard character that matches any sequence of characters (including no characters). It can be powerful but dangerous when used with `rm`.

**Example:** To remove all files in the current directory whose names start with `costdata`:

```bash
rm costdata*
```

**Important:** Be **VERY** careful when using wildcards with `rm`. You might permanently delete more files than intended. It is highly recommended to first list the files that match the pattern using `ls` before deleting them:

```bash
ls costdata*  # Check which files will be matched
rm costdata*  # Only run this after verifying the ls output
```

## Creating Directories

The `mkdir` command is used to create new directories (folders).

**Syntax:**

```bash
mkdir directory_name
```

**Example:** To create a new directory named `study1`:

```bash
mkdir study1
```

You can also create directories within other directories, forming a hierarchy.

**Example:** To create a directory `costProject` in your current location:

```bash
mkdir costProject
```

## Deleting Directories

### `rmdir` (for empty directories)

The `rmdir` command is used to remove **empty** directories.

**Syntax:**

```bash
rmdir directory_name
```

**Example:** To remove the empty directory `study1`:

```bash
rmdir study1
```

If the directory contains any files or subdirectories, `rmdir` will fail.

### `rm -r` (for non-empty directories)

To remove a directory and all its contents (files and subdirectories), use the `rm` command with the `-r` (recursive) option.

**Syntax:**

```bash
rm -r directory_name
```

**Example:** To remove the directory `costProject` and everything inside it:

```bash
rm -r costProject
```

**Warning:** Using `rm -r` is powerful and permanently deletes the directory and its entire contents. Double-check the directory name before executing this command.
