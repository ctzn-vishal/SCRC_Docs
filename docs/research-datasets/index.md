# Research Datasets

Welcome to the Research Datasets section of the SCRC documentation. This area is dedicated to helping you discover, access, and utilize the extensive collection of research datasets available to support your work. Whether you're conducting financial analysis, exploring market trends, or investigating economic indicators, this guide provides the essential information you need.

## Overview

Understanding and accessing research data is crucial for impactful analysis. This section covers two primary areas:

1.  **Available Datasets:** We provide an overview of the major datasets accessible through SCRC, encompassing a wide range of financial, marketing, and economic information.
2.  **Access Methods (WRDS):** Many premier datasets are available via **Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS)**. We detail the process for obtaining and managing a WRDS account, which is your gateway to these powerful resources.

Our goal is to streamline your access to the data you need, enabling you to focus on your research.
