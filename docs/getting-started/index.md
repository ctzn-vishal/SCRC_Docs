# Getting Started with SCRC

Welcome to the Stern Center for Research Computing (SCRC)! This section provides the essential information you need to begin using our computational resources. Whether you're a Stern affiliate, part of the wider NYU community, or an external collaborator, these guides will walk you through the initial steps.

Our goal here is to help you quickly:

1.  **Obtain access:** Understand the process for getting your SCRC account based on your affiliation.
2.  **Connect securely:** Learn how to log in to our clusters from your computer, including necessary steps like using the NYU VPN when off-campus.
3.  **Understand the environment:** Get acquainted with the first steps after logging in and know when SCRC is the right resource compared to NYU's central HPC facilities.

Follow these guides to get up and running smoothly on the SCRC systems.
