# Requesting a Virtual Machine

This page explains how researchers at NYU Stern can request a dedicated virtual machine (VM) from the Stern Center for Research Computing (SCRC) for specialized research requirements.

## Overview

The SCRC maintains a small VMWare cloud environment to support researchers who have specialized computing needs that are not met by the standard HPC cluster or other shared resources. This private cloud allows SCRC to quickly provide customized virtual machines.

VMs offer several benefits:
*   **Customization:** Specify the amount of memory, disk space, number of processors, operating system (Windows or Linux), and required software.
*   **Accessibility:** Access your VM from anywhere (office, home, abroad) via the network. An NYU VPN connection is required for off-campus access.
*   **Collaboration:** Facilitates collaboration with geographically distant colleagues.
*   **Efficiency:** Quickly provisioned and configured computing resources without the financial overhead of purchasing physical hardware for individual needs.
*   **Isolation:** Frees up your personal computer and provides a dedicated environment for your research tasks.

## How to Request a VM

To request a dedicated virtual machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Determine Your Needs:** Identify the specific requirements for your VM, such as:
    *   Operating System (Windows or Linux)
    *   Number of CPU cores
    *   Amount of RAM (Memory)
    *   Required Disk Space
    *   Any specialized software needed

2.  **Send an Email Request:** Compose an email to the SCRC support list:
    *   **To:** `scrc-list@stern.nyu.edu`
    *   **Subject:** Virtual Machine Request
    *   **Body:** Include a clear description of your research needs and the required VM specifications (as determined in step 1).

3.  **Consultation (If Necessary):** SCRC staff will review your request. They may schedule a brief meeting to discuss your requirements in more detail to ensure the VM is configured appropriately.

4.  **Provisioning:** Once the details are finalized, SCRC can typically provision and provide access to the VM within a day or so.

## Typical VM Specifications

While specifications are customizable, a typical VM configuration provided by SCRC includes:

*   **CPU:** 6 cores
*   **RAM:** 32GB

If your needs differ significantly (e.g., requiring GPUs or substantially more resources), please specify this clearly in your request email.
