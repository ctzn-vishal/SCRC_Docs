# Storage Solutions

Welcome to the Storage Solutions section of the SCRC documentation! This area provides essential information on how to effectively manage your files and data within the SCRC computing environment. Understanding where to store different types of data and how to move files between systems is crucial for efficient research and analysis.

## Overview

Navigating SCRC's storage options ensures your data is safe, accessible, and stored appropriately for your computational needs. Here, you'll learn about:

*   **Home Directories:** Your personal space for configuration files, small scripts, and documents.
*   **Bigdata Storage (`bigdata` / `bighome`):** Dedicated space designed for large datasets used in your research and computational tasks. This is where you should store large files and create virtual environments.
*   **File Management:** Methods for transferring files between your local computer and SCRC's remote servers.

Properly utilizing these storage solutions helps maintain system performance and ensures you have the resources you need for your work.
