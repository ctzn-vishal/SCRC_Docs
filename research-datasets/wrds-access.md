# Accessing WRDS (Wharton Research Data Services)

Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) is an internet-based business data research service from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. It provides access to a wide array of historical financial, accounting, banking, economics, management, marketing, and public policy databases through a uniform web interface. This page outlines how NYU Stern users can access WRDS resources.

## How to Access WRDS

There are two main ways to access WRDS:

### Access Without an Account

You can access the WRDS website without a personal account using **WRDS Connect** public workstations available at **Bobst Library**. This provides access to the web query interface but lacks features like personal workspace or server access.

Some datasets might also be accessible via Stern wireless networks without an account, but this is often limited compared to account access.

### Access With an Account

Users with an approved WRDS account can log in directly via the [Wharton Research Database Services website](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/).

Account holders (Faculty, PhD, Research Assistant) benefit from:

*   Personal and shared workspace on the WRDS server.
*   Saved query history.
*   Secure SSH access to the WRDS Linux server (`wrds.wharton.upenn.edu`) for accessing data directly (e.g., SAS datasets, sequential data) and running programs (SAS, FORTRAN, C supported).

## Requesting a WRDS Account

NYU faculty, administrators, staff, and students are eligible to apply for a WRDS account.

*   **Faculty, PhD Students, Staff:** Can apply for standard accounts.
*   **Non-PhD Students:** May request a Research Assistant (RA) account for a limited time if working with a faculty member on research.
*   **Class Accounts:** Faculty can request accounts for their classes, allowing students off-campus access for coursework.

**Steps to Request an Account:**

1.  Navigate to the [Wharton Research Database Services website](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/).
