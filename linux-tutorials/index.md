# Linux Tutorials

Welcome to the Linux Tutorials section! If you're new to using the command line interface (CLI) on Linux systems, or just need a refresher, you've come to the right place. This collection of tutorials provides a foundation for navigating and interacting with the Linux environment commonly used within the SCRC.

Understanding the Linux command line is essential for effectively using our computing resources. These guides will walk you through the basics, starting with navigating the file system and progressing to managing files, understanding permissions, and utilizing powerful command-line tools.

Here you'll find step-by-step instructions covering core concepts such as:

*   **Basic Navigation:** Moving around the directory structure.
*   **File Operations:** Creating, viewing, modifying, and deleting files and directories.
*   **Permissions:** Understanding who can read, write, or execute files.
*   **Pipes & Redirection:** Controlling the input and output of commands.
*   **Getting Help:** Finding documentation and using command-line shortcuts.

Browse the topics below to get started:

*   **[Linux Introduction and Basic Navigation](./linux-introduction-navigation.md)**
    *   Introduction to the Linux command line, shell prompt, basic commands like `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, and understanding the directory structure.

*   **[Linux Command Line Tips and Help](./linux-command-line-tips.md)**
    *   Useful command line features like command history, auto-completion, online help (`man`), and basic cursor control.
